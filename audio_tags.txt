# AUDIO TAGS

ElevenLabs Audio Tags are words wrapped in square brackets that the new Eleven v3 model can interpret and use to direct the audible action. They can be anything from `[excited]`, `[whispers]`, and `[sighs]` through to `[gunshot]`, `[clapping]` and `[explosion]`.

Audio Tags let you shape how AI voices sound, including nonverbal cues like tone, pauses, and pacing. Whether you're building immersive audiobooks, interactive characters, or dialogue-driven media, these simple script-level tools give you precise control over emotion and delivery.

You can place Audio Tags anywhere in your script to shape delivery in real time. You can also use combinations of tags within a script or even a sentence. Tags fall into core categories:
    - **Emotions**: These tags can help you set the emotional tone of the voice — whether it's somber, intense, or upbeat. For example you could use one or a combination of `[sad]`, `[angry]`, `[happily]` and `[sorrowful]`.
    - **Delivery direction**: These are more about the tone and performance. You can use these tags to adjust volume and energy for scenes that need restraint or force. Examples include: `[whispers]`, `[shouts]` and even `[x accent]`.
    - **Human reactions**: True natural speech includes reactions. For example, you can use this to add realism by embedding natural, unscripted moments into speech. For example: `[laughs]`, `[clears throat]` and `[sighs]`.

## Situational Awareness

Tags such as `[WHISPER]`, `[SHOUTING]`, and `[SIGH]` let Eleven v3 react to the moment—raising stakes, softening warnings, or pausing for suspense.
Situational awareness means the AI adapts its delivery to fit the moment. With Audio Tags, you control not just what the model says — but how it responds.

Audio Tags let you simulate a range of emotional and physical cues:

- Emotional tone: `[EXCITED]`, `[NERVOUS]`, `[FRUSTRATED]`,`[TIRED]`
- Reactions: `[GASP]`, `[SIGH]`, `[LAUGHS]`, `[GULPS]`
- Volume & energy: `[WHISPERING]`, `[SHOUTING]`, `[QUIETLY]`, `[LOUDLY]`
- Pacing & rhythm: `[PAUSES]`, `[STAMMERS]`, `[RUSHED]`

## Character Performance

From `[pirate voice]` to `[French accent]`, tags turn narration into role-play. Shift persona mid-line and direct full-on character performances without changing models.

Character-focused tags allow you to shape vocal identity and presence:

- Accents & dialects: `[British accent]`, `[Australian accent],` `[Southern US accent]`
- Archetypes & roles: `[pirate voice]`, `[evil scientist voice]`, `[childlike tone]`
- Speech styles: `[dramatic]`, `[sarcastically]`, `[matter-of-fact]`, `[whiny]`
- Genre cues: `[fantasy narrator],` `[sci-fi AI voice]`, `[classic film noir]`

## Emotional Context

Cues like `[sigh]`, `[excited]`, or `[tired]` steer feelings moment by moment, layering tension, relief, or humour—no re-recording needed.

Here are some frequently used tags to direct emotional performance:

- Emotional states: `[excited]`, `[nervous],` `[frustrated]`, `[sorrowful]`, `[calm]`
- Reactions: `[sigh]`, `[laughs]`, `[gulps]`, `[gasps]`, `[whispers]`
- Cognitive beats: `[pauses]`, `[hesitates]`, `[stammers]`, `[resigned tone]`
- Tone cues: `[cheerfully]`, `[flatly]`, `[deadpan]`, `[playfully]`

These can be combined or sequenced for richer emotional arcs: `[hesitant]` I... I didn’t mean to say that. `[regretful]` It just came out.

## Narrative Intelligence

Storytelling is timing. Tags such as `[pause]`, `[awe]`, or `[dramatic tone]` control rhythm and emphasis so AI voices guide the listener through each beat.

Here are some tags that help direct longform delivery, internal monologue, and exposition:

- Story beats: `[pause]`, `[continues softly]`, `[hesitates]`, `[resigned]`
- Tone setting: `[dramatic tone]`, `[lighthearted]`, `[reflective]`, `[serious tone]`
- Narrator POV: `[awe]`, `[sarcastic tone]`, `[wistful]`, `[matter-of-fact]`
- Rhythm & flow: `[slows down]`, `[rushed]`, `[emphasized]`
- These can be sequenced for subtle build-up: `[reflective]` I never thought I’d say this, but... `[pause]` maybe the machine was right.

## Delivery Control

Fine-tune pacing and emphasis. Tags like `[pause]`, `[rushed]`, or `[drawn out]` give precision over tempo, turning plain text into performance.

Tags give you access to the subtle cues humans use to pace speech naturally:

- Pauses & breaks: `[pause]`, `[breathes]`, `[continues after a beat]`
- Speed cues: `[rushed]`, `[slows down]`, `[deliberate]`, `[rapid-fire]`
- Hesitation & rhythm: `[stammers]`, `[drawn out]`, `[repeats]`, `[timidly]`
- Emphasis: `[emphasized]`, `[stress on next word]`, `[understated]`
